## The voting system

In the year 2999, when everyone is fed up with the imperial governments, a new form of government is proposed. With the imperial government, most of the problems arise due to the incompetency of the ruler, who is selected by the previous king. The people who this new king would rule over have no say in the selection process. 

To remove this paradox, mathematicians propose a new form of government called **Consensus Government**. The main idea behind this consensus government would be that people would choose their own ruler.

## How will the consensus government work?

According to the proposal, the consensus government will have two types of rulers, *temporary rulers (TRs)* and a *king*. The temporary rulers will rule the country for a *grace period* of 4 months, and once a temporary ruler is promoted to the king, he will go on and rule the country for 4 years till the next elections.

Statisticians who have proposed the system believe that everyone among the population should have an equal chance to become a ruler, and therefore, the temporary rulers will be chosen uniformly at random from the people of the country. Once the selected person steps up as a TR, he will have 4 months to please the people. At the end of his 4-month term, there will be a final judgment day when people will either promote him to a king's position or dethrone him.

If he is dethroned, the process is repeated again until the country has a suitable ruler. On the contrary, if he is promoted, he rules the country for 4 years till the next election, when the whole process is repeated.
