## The voting system

In the year 2999, when everyone is fed up by the imperial governments, a new form of government is proposed. With the imperial government, most of the problems arise due to incompetency of the ruler, which is selected by the previous king. The people who this new king would rule over have no say in the selection process. 

To remove this paradox, mathematicians propose a new for of government called **Concensus Government**. The main idea behind this consensus government would be that people would choose their own ruler.
